      "The investors will design, build, finance and operate the water storage and treatment plant and transmission line to a bulk delivery point. The investors will negotiate and sign a Bulk Water Purchase Agreement with the designated public entity.

A letter of support from GoK will ensure that the designated public entities always remit the amounts due to the private party.",

    question:
      "What is the interface of the projects and Non-Revenue Water (NRW) and Water Last Mile Connectivity?",
    answer: `
        The government is cognizant of the potential negative impacts of NRW and last mile infrastructure deficit on project viability. Therefore, National and county government are working together to ensure connectedness between bulk and retail water services. Whereas the public entity will primarily be responsible for the development and management downstream works, part of last mile investment may be included as part of the PPP project for bulk water supply or under separate management contract. The specific requirement for each project will be detailed in the Request for Proposal (RFP) document.`,

    question:
      "Will investors have an opportunity to negotiate the project structuring and associated risks?",
    answer: `
        In the first step, the private party will propose structure that will optimally deliver on the project, and allocate responsibilities and rights of each party. The private party will also be expected to identify and assess the different categories of risks associated with the project, alternative tools for managing risk, and proposed allocations of the residual risk. This submission will form the basis for negotiation with the Contracting Authority.`,
  },
  {
    question:
      "Are the tariffs in US Dollars or Kenya Shillings and if the latter, are the investors protected from the Foreign Exchange risks?",
    answer:
      "The tariffs will be charged in Kenya Shillings. Government and investors will discuss the sharing of currency exchange risk, where this applies, and depending on the nature and source of the exchange rate risk. The government expects and encourages the investors to explore project design choices that reduce exposure to currency risks and other risks.",
